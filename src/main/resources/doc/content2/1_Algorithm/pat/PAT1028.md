#### 题目

Excel can sort records according to any column. Now you are supposed to imitate this function.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains two integers N (≤10<sup>5</sup>) and C, 
where N is the number of records and C is the column that you are supposed to sort the records with. 
Then N lines follow, each contains a record of a student. 
A student's record consists of his or her distinct ID (a 6-digit number), 
name (a string with no more than 8 characters without space), 
and grade (an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive).

Output Specification:

For each test case, output the sorting result in N lines. 
That is, if C = 1 then the records must be sorted in increasing order according to ID's; 
if C = 2 then the records must be sorted in non-decreasing order according to names; 
and if C = 3 then the records must be sorted in non-decreasing order according to grades. 
If there are several students who have the same name or grade, 
they must be sorted according to their ID's in increasing order.

Sample Input 1:
```text
3 1
000007 James 85
000010 Amy 90
000001 Zoe 60
```
      
    
Sample Output 1:
```text
000001 Zoe 60
000007 James 85
000010 Amy 90
```
      
    
Sample Input 2:
```text
4 2
000007 James 85
000010 Amy 90
000001 Zoe 60
000002 James 98
```
      
    
Sample Output 2:
```text
000010 Amy 90
000002 James 98
000007 James 85
000001 Zoe 60
```
      
    
Sample Input 3:
```text
4 3
000007 James 85
000010 Amy 90
000001 Zoe 60
000002 James 90
```
      
    
Sample Output 3:
```text
000001 Zoe 60
000007 James 85
000002 James 90
000010 Amy 90
```

#### 思路

题意很简单，就不解释了，简单的排序，需要注意使用cin 和 cout 会出现超时


#### 实现代码(C++) PAT已验证通过

```c++

#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct People{
    int id;
    string name;
    int grade;
};

int N,K;

bool cmp(People a,People b){
    if (K == 1) {
        return a.id<b.id;
    }else if(K == 2){
        if (a.name == b.name) {
            return a.id<b.id;
        }else{
            return a.name<b.name;
        }
    }else{
        if (a.grade == b.grade) {
              return a.id<b.id;
          }else{
              return a.grade<b.grade;
          }
    }
}
int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    cin>>N>>K;
    People peoples[N];
    int id;
    char name[100];
    int grade;
    People p;
    for (int i=0; i<N; ++i) {
        scanf("%d %s %d",&id,name,&grade);
        p.id = id;
        p.name = name;
        p.grade = grade;
        peoples[i] = p;
    }
    sort(peoples, peoples+N, cmp);
    for (int i=0; i<N; ++i) {
        printf("%06d %s %d\n",peoples[i].id,peoples[i].name.c_str(),peoples[i].grade);
    }
    return 0;
}

```
